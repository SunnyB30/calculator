Thank-you for looking at my first attempt at creating a web application. I have created an online calculator using HTML, javascript and CSS. Some of the features I have included are: 

1. A limit of 7 numbers able to be entered by the user into the display. 
2. If the display exceeds 7 characters (after calculation of a result) a basic algorithm is used to reduce the size of the display characters to fit. This effect increases with the amount of numbers. 
3. A backspace button that allows deletion of one character at a time, unless the result is displayed from a previous calculation where it defaults to zero. 
4. An AC button that resets the display to zero. 
5. A percentage button that changes colour to green when in use. It can only be used following a number and cannot be used on a default screen. It can also be used after a result is displayed. 
6. The ability to continue operations following one calculation either by pressing equals first and then a new operator or by just selecting a new operator- if selecting a new operator the result will be displayed before any new numbers are entered. 
7. A change sign button that allows any number displayed to have its sign changed. 
8. A decimal point button that can only be activated one at a time in the display. It also has the ability to add a zero if pressed right after the result of a previous calculation. 
9. The ability to use the calculator using keyboard input. 

I am still working on: 

1. Rounding of certain results; currently if 10/3 * 3 is entered is returns a value of 9.999999, I am trying to find a way to have this equal to 10.
